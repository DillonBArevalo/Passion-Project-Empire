### Summary

This website is a character creator for my Tabletop RPG I'm creating with my friend John (Jack) Wostrel.
As of right now it doesn't much resemble the actual game as it's in its infancy. I hope to actually add game relevant stats and information soon but I want the site to run smoothly first. You can reference my MVP and stretch goals in [user stories](/user_stories.md)

### Notes:

Note that the initial commit is supposedly done by "Julie Sylvia." This is because I just got a new computer and am working on my mother's account until I have time to set up my own. I figured out how to set the git user after that initial commit. All work done by "Julie Sylvia" is actually still done by me, Dillon Arevalo.
